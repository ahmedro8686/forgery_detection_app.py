Image Forgery Detection App (Python + Streamlit)

ðŸ“Œ Overview

This Python + Streamlit application detects potential forged or manipulated regions in digital images by combining illumination analysis, edge detection, texture patterns (LBP), noise frequency mapping (DCT), and statistical anomaly detection (z-score). It integrates multiple advanced computer vision techniques to highlight suspicious areas and visualize anomalies interactively and intuitively.

ðŸ›  Features

    Illumination Map Analysis â€“ Detects unnatural lighting variations.

    Edge Detection (Canny) â€“ Highlights sharp and unusual boundaries.

    Texture Analysis (Local Binary Patterns - LBP) â€“ Finds inconsistencies in surface patterns.

    Noise Analysis (Discrete Cosine Transform - DCT) â€“ Detects abnormal high-frequency patterns indicative of tampering.

    Statistical Anomaly Detection (Z-score) â€“ Identifies statistically significant irregularities across combined feature maps.

    Interactive Threshold Control â€“ Real-time sensitivity adjustment for anomaly detection.

    Heatmap Overlay â€“ Visual representation of detected anomalies over the original image.

    Downloadable Results â€“ Save the processed images and binary anomaly masks.

    Cross-platform Compatibility â€“ Run locally with Python or deploy easily on Streamlit Cloud.

ðŸš€ How to Run

Option 1 â€“ Local Execution

    Install Python (>= 3.8).

    Install dependencies:
    pip install -r requirements.txt

    Run the app:
    streamlit run forgery_detection_app.py

    Upload an image in the web interface and adjust the analysis settings as needed.

Option 2 â€“ Streamlit Cloud Deployment

    Push your project to a GitHub repository.

    Visit Streamlit Cloud.

    Link your GitHub repo and select forgery_detection_app.py as the main file.

    Streamlit Cloud will install dependencies automatically and deploy your app online.
